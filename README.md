Project Summary
My analysis explores overall restaurant performance by pulling insights from orders, revenue, customer satisfaction, order type behavior, payment preferences, pricing, preparation time, and time based demand patterns.
The data shows a total of 296 orders, generating roughly 9.28K in revenue, with a customer satisfaction score of 0.71. I examined different factors that affect customer activity and revenue generation, such as order type, payment method, unit price, preparation time, and the timing of orders across the day and month.

Key Insights
1. Takeout drives the most revenue
Takeout leads with about 3.6K, followed by Delivery at 3.2K, and Dine In at 2.5K. This indicates customers prefer convenience and speed.
2. Mobile and Debit payments dominate
Mobile payments bring in the highest revenue at 2.3K, with Debit close behind at 2.1K. This suggests customers lean toward quick and digital payment methods.
3. Higher unit prices often align with higher order counts
The chart shows spikes in both order count and quantity at specific price points, meaning customers are not strictly price sensitive and will pay more when value is clear.
4. Customer rating impacts preparation time
Ratings around 4 show the longest prep time. Lower ratings show lower average prep times, which could imply customers penalize longer waits.
5. Monthly order count peaks mid cycle
Orders jump significantly in the second and third month, signaling either growth or a seasonal pattern.
6. Time based orders fluctuate throughout the day
Late afternoon and evening show more frequent spikes, which aligns with typical dining behavior.

Recommendations for Restaurant Service Improvement
1. Strengthen Takeout operations
Since Takeout leads revenue, invest in:
•	Faster pickup workflows
•	Dedicated takeout staff
•	Improved packaging to keep food quality consistent
2. Promote digital payments
Highlight Mobile and Debit options in store and online. Offer small incentives for digital payment to speed up checkout.
3. Review pricing strategy
Since customers accept higher unit prices at certain ranges, test:
•	Premium menu items
•	Bundles that increase average spend
•	Limited time offers tied to high performing price points
4. Reduce prep time for high rating segments
Higher prep times around top ratings may risk future satisfaction. Improve by:
•	Streamlining kitchen workflow
•	Preparing base ingredients during off peak hours
•	Adding clear ticket priority rules
5. Prepare for mid month and evening spikes
Staffing should match real demand patterns. Add:
•	Extra kitchen staff during peak hours
•	Faster order routing during busy evenings
6. Improve dine in appeal
Since Dine In revenue is lowest:
•	Enhance ambience
•	Train staff for quicker table service
•	Add dine in exclusive items
